RECEPTIVE FIELD dimension
Because different tasks need neurons to capture different types of information:
Small RF → useful for detecting fine details (edges, textures).
Large RF → needed for detecting large patterns (shapes, objects, context).
Whole-image RF → needed for tasks like classification or segmentation.
